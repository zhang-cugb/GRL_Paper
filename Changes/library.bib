abstract = {Streamline-based methods can be used as effective post-process-ing tools for assessing flow patterns and well allocation factors in reservoir simulation. This type of diagnostic information can be useful for a number of applications, including visualization, model ranking, upscaling validation, and optimization of well placement or injection allocation. In this paper, we investigate fi-nite-volume methods as an alternative to streamlines for obtaining flow diagnostic information. Given a computed flux field, we solve the stationary transport equations for tracer and time of flight by use of either single-point upstream (SPU) weighting or a truly multidimensional upstream (MDU) weighting scheme. We use tracer solutions to partition the reservoir into volumes associ-ated with injector/producer pairs and to calculate fluxes (well allo-cation factors) associated with each volume. The heterogeneity of the reservoir is assessed with time of flight to construct flow-capacity/storage-capacity (F-vs.-U) diagrams that can be used to estimate sweep efficiency. We compare the results of our approach with streamline-based calculations for several numerical examples, and we demonstrate that finite-volume methods are a viable alternative. The primary advantages of finite-volume meth-ods are the applicability to unstructured grids and the ease of implementation for general-purpose simulation formulations. The main disadvantage is numerical diffusion, but we show that a MDU weighting scheme is able to reduce these errors. Introduction Many applications require us to rank, compare, and validate reser-voir models and production scenarios rapidly. Any full-featured multiphase reservoir simulator can be used for such purposes, but these time-dependent simulations can be too computationally in-tensive if the number of models is large or if the size of an indi-vidual model is large. For this reason, we are interested in flow diagnostic tools that can provide quantitative information on the basis of stationary (steady-state) flow. For a fixed flow field, we desire tools that can partition the reservoir model into swept (drained) regions associated with injectors (producers). In addi-tion, we would like to compute volumes and fluxes (well alloca-tion factors) associated with injector/producer pairs and provide a means of assessing the heterogeneity of models. Many authors have shown that streamline-based simulation methods can access this type of diagnostic information. For exam-ple, Thiele and Batycky (2003) optimized injection-and produc-tion-well rates in waterflooding by use of a streamline-based approach for calculating fluxes between well pairs. In a more recent study, Batycky et al. (2008) showed how streamlines have application in flood surveillance on a pattern-by-pattern basis. Shook and Mitchell (2009) used streamline-based simulation to rank earth models on the basis of heterogeneity. They computed dynamic flow-capacity/storage-capacity (F-vs.-U) diagrams on the basis of steady-state flow and explained how the curves can be used to estimate sweep efficiency. These curves were used to cal-culate Lorenz coefficients, which provided a robust measure of heterogeneity. We find the use of the F-vs.-U curve a convenient way to assess heterogeneity, and we use the same strategy here but with different numerical methods. Although we acknowledge the strengths of streamline-based flow diagnostics, we believe that it is worthwhile to consider alter-natives. For nearly orthogonal structured grids, streamline-tracing algorithms are accurate and efficient. However, care is needed to handle the more-general corner-point grids used in practice. For example, special treatment is required to handle degenerate or highly distorted hexahedral cells, mismatched cells across faults, pinchouts, and local grid-refinement interfaces. Streamline tracing for grids composed of more general polyhedral cells is less effi-cient than in the structured case and continues to be an area of ongoing research. In addition, dual-permeability simulations and discrete fracture models (e.g., Moinfar et al. 2011) are not amena-ble to standard streamline-tracing algorithms. The majority of simulators used in commercial applications are designed on the basis of finite-volume methods. Hence, the workflows that support these simulations are likewise designed to support finite-volume calculations. The architecture of next-generation finite-volume simulators has succeeded in achieving a high degree of generality (e.g., DeBaun et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2011). That is, many types of multiphase simulations can be per-formed using the same data structures, discretization schemes, and solvers. Our interest in finite-volume methods for flow diag-nostic calculations stems from a desire for this same generality and widespread applicability. Ideally, flow diagnostic tools should be compatible with many model types (e.g., structured, unstruc-tured, dual-permeability, discrete fracture), and they should require input parameters that are available within existing work-flows and simulators. The robustness that comes from mass con-servation also makes finite-volume methods attractive candidates for flow diagnostic tools. Our approach is based on the work of Natvig et al. (2007) and Natvig and Lie (2008), who developed fast solvers for stationary transport equations using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite-element methods. Specifically, they used an optimal reordering of unknowns to compute fast solutions to the stationary tracer equa-tion and the time-of-flight equation. In other studies, Eikemo et al. (2006) applied this same technique to discrete fracture systems, and Eikemo et al. (2009) further showed the generality of DG methods by considering unstructured triangular grids. In this paper, we introduce finite-volume discretizations of the same stationary tracer and time-of-flight equations, and we extract diagnostic information on the basis of their solutions. Our simplest discretization is based on SPU weighting, which corre-sponds to the lowest-order DG scheme. We also investigate a truly MDU weighting scheme that is monotonic and reduces transverse numerical diffusion (Kozdon et al. 2009; Kozdon et al. 2011; Keilegavlen 2010). The resulting discrete systems can be solved efficiently using the approach of Natvig et al. (2007). Solu-tions to the stationary tracer equation are used to partition the reservoir into well regions and calculate fluxes for each injector/ producer pair. Solutions to forward and backward time-of-flight equations are used to calculate flow-capacity/flow-storage dia-grams and Lorenz coefficients that have application in assessing heterogeneity.},

@article{Sablok2008,
abstract = {Reservoir simulation models are used as an everyday tool for reservoir management. The number of grid blocks in a simulation model is generally much smaller than the number of the grid blocks in the geological model. The geological model is therefore regularly upscaled for building reasonably sized simulation models. Any upscaling causes a loss in detail and introduces errors. Understanding the nature of the errors that occur due to the upscaling step is important because it can provide a handle on the kind of upscaling to be performed and the optimum level of upscaling. Furthermore, understanding interaction of gridding and upscaling errors is essential for building reliable simulation models. In this article, we analyze errors introduced due to the upscaling step. First, the generality of the purely local single-phase upscaling is considered and the errors introduced due to its use in complex multiphase flows and investigated. Three kinds of errors, namely total upscaling errors, discretization errors, and errors due to the loss of heterogeneity are defined, and their behavior as a function of the level of upscaling is studied for different types of permeability distributions. The reasons for apparently low total upscaling errors at high levels of upscaling are investigated. The efficacy of the geostatistical tools (variograms, QQ plots) for understanding the geological structure of the upscaled models, as compared to the reference model, is tested for different cases. Second, the uncertainty introduced in the flow results due to the upscaling errors is studied in conjunction with the uncertainty incorporated through the introduction of geological variability in the ensemble of geological models. The behavior of upscaling errors and geological variability as a function of level of upscaling is studied, and its possible impact on important reservoir management decisions is analyzed. It is shown that the uncertainty models of cumulative oil profiles, obtained from flow results of highly upscaled models can contain significant uncertainties. These uncertainties are a result of upscaling errors and therefore cannot be considered to represent only geological uncertainty, which is captured by the introduction of geological variability in the ensemble of the geological models.},

@article{Bourbiaux2010,
abstract = {The recent years have seen a growing awareness of the role played by fractures in petroleum reservoirs production and recovery. Hence, much effort was devoted to the diagnosis of fracture presence and impact on production. However, turning that diagnosis into field development decisions goes through reservoir simulation. This paper addresses some of the specificities of fractured reservoirs that make that their simulation is both challenging and rewarding. Indeed, the integration of fractures into a flow simulation model is not straightforward because of the existing gap between the geological fault/fracture network and the fingerprint of that network on often-complex recovery mechanisms. Considering that fractures may impede or enhance production, fractured reservoir simulation may be seen as a technical challenge with potentially-high reward. This paper underlines that specific framework as an introduction to two technical articles dedicated to dual-porosity reservoir simulation. Although it constitutes another major aspect of any fractured reservoir study, the geological characterization of fractures is not discussed herein, but only evoked because of more and more integration of static and dynamic aspects.},

abstract = {We use random resistor network models to explore the relationship between electrical resistivity and permeability in a fracture filled with an electrically conductive fluid. Fluid flow and current are controlled by both the distribution and the volume of pore space. Therefore, the aperture distribution of fractures must be accurately modeled in order to realistically represent their hydraulic and electrical properties. We have constructed fracture surface pairs based on characteristics measured on rock samples. We use these to construct resistor networks with variable hydraulic and electrical resistance in order to investigate the changes in both properties as a fault is opened. At small apertures, electrical conductivity and permeability increase moderately with aperture until the fault reaches its percolation threshold. Above this point, the permeability increases by 4 orders of magnitude over a change in mean aperture of less than 0.1 mm, while the resistivity decreases by up to a factor of 10 over this aperture change. Because permeability increases at a greater rate than matrix to fracture resistivity ratio, the percolation threshold can also be defined in terms of the matrix to fracture resistivity ratio, M. The value of M at the percolation threshold, M PT , varies with the ratio of rock to fluid resistivity, the fault spacing, and the fault offset. However, M PT is almost always less than 10. Greater M values are associated with fractures above their percolation threshold. Therefore, if such M values are observed over fluid-filled fractures, it is likely that they are open for fluid flow.},

abstract = {Permeability in fractured carbonate reservoirs is very heterogeneous due to fracturing at different scales superimposed on inherent textures from deposition and diagenesis. Observations of fractures in core and outcrop indicate that flow in open fractures in carbonate rock tends to be channelled rather than through fissures. Most of the flow takes place along a few dominating channels in the fracture plane, whereas most of the fracture plane is not effective for fluid flow. The formation of flow channels is caused by a combination of mechanical and, in particular, diagenetic processes. Single extension fractures occur as partly open or vuggy fractures, and their hydraulic properties are controlled by dissolution and cementation. Single shear fractures are typically open at local steps in the fault plane controlled by shearing along irregular fracture surfaces. Fault damage zones tend to be concentrated at fault tips, intersections, pull-aparts and overlap zones that represent areas of dilation. These damage zones represent elongated features in three dimensions with a high fracture density that will result in channelled flow at reservoir scales. The effect of channelled flow should be taken into account during evaluation of fractured carbonate reservoirs and when building dynamic flow models. },

abstract = {A method to represent fracture networks in a continuum model is evaluated by an application to the {\"{A}}sp{\"{o}} Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL). The basic approach of the method is to first generate a fracture network, based on data from field measurements and then represent the network as grid cell conductivities, using a staggered grid arrangement. It is argued that the resulting conductivity fields capture the correlation and anisotropy structures, as well as the mean conductivity, of the rock in a realistic way. The main objective is to evaluate if the suggested method can be used in an application to a real site. The objective is formulated in three questions: 'Can the method utilize available field data?', 'Can the generated fields be calibrated and conditioned? and 'Are realistic distributions of pressure, flow and density obtained?'. From the application to the {\"{A}}sp{\"{o}} HRL, it is concluded that the hydraulic conductivity fields, generated by the suggested method, can utilize field data and be calibrated. It is also demonstrated that realistic distributions of pressure, flow and density can be simulated. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Solute transport in fractured porous media is typically “non-Fickian”; that is, it is characterized by early breakthrough and long tailing and by nonlinear growth of the Green function–centered second moment. This behavior is due to the effects of (1) multirate diffusion occurring between the highly permeable fracture network and the low permeability rock matrix, (2) a wide range of advection rates in the fractures and, possibly, the matrix as well, and (3) a range of path lengths. As a consequence, prediction of solute transport processes at the macroscale represents a formidable challenge. Classical dual porosity (or mobile immobile) approaches in conjunction with an advection dispersion equation and macroscopic dispersivity commonly fail to predict breakthrough of fractured porous media accurately. It was recently demonstrated that the continuous time random walk (CTRW) method can be used as a generalized upscaling approach. Here we extend this work and use results from high resolution finite element–finite volume–based simulations of solute transport in an outcrop analogue of a naturally fractured reservoir to calibrate the CTRW method by extracting a distribution of retention times. This procedure allows us to predict breakthrough at other model locations accurately and to gain significant insight into the nature of the fracture matrix interaction in naturally fractured porous reservoirs with geologically realistic fracture geometries.},

abstract = {We develop a physically motivated approach to modeling displacement processes in fractured reservoirs. To find matrix/ fracture transfer functions in a dual-porosity model, we use analytical expressions for the average recovery as a function of time for gas gravity drainage and countercurrent imbibition. For capillary-controlled displacement, the recovery tends to its, ultimate value with an approximately exponential decay (Barenblatt et al. 1990). When gravity dominates, the approach to ultimate recovery is slower and varies as a power law with time (Hagoort 1980). We apply transfer functions based on these expressions for core-scale recovery in field-scale simulation. To account for heterogeneity in wettability, matrix permeability, and fracture geometry within a single gridblock, we propose a multirate model (Ponting 2004). We allow the matrix to be composed of a series of separate domains in communication with different fracture sets with different rate constants in the transfer function. We use this methodology to simulate recovery in a Chinese oil field to assess the efficiency of different injection processes. We use a streamline-based formulation that elegantly allows the transfer between fracture and matrix to be accommodated as source terms in the ID transport equations along streamlines that capture the flow in the fractures (Di Donato et al. 2003; Di Donato and Blunt 2004; Huang et al. 2004). This approach contrasts with the current Darcy-like formulation for fracture/matrix transfer based on a shape factor (Gilman and Kazemi 1983) that may not give the correct average behavior (Di Donato et al. 2003; Di Donato and Blunt 2004; Huang et al. 2004). Furthermore, we show that recovery is exceptionally sensitive to parameters that describe the physics of the displacement process, highlighting the need to make careful core-scale measurements of recovery.},

This work performs a methodology aiming a suitable representation of flow simulation and upscaling techniques according to small and large scale carbonate reservoir heterogeneities. The methodology is applied to one specific flow unit type considering diffuse fractures, sub-seismic fractures and isolated vugs.The methodology follows four elementary steps: division of reservoir into flow units, geostatistical modeling, upscaling procedures and flow simulation modeling of carbonate reservoirs. Given the presence of multiscale geological features and computational limitations, the upscaling procedure is separated as a function of heterogeneities scale.The process is shown for one flow unit of a specific case where flow progress in matrix and fracture occur at different time steps which make the single porosity approach difficult. For regions of fractures not fully connected, the flow takes place in the matrix. A dual permeability flow model is the best approach since it can take into account both flow progresses in connected fracture networks and in matrix medium.The methodology has shown several advantages: sequential control over static properties and pseudo-functions integrated with upscaling procedure; definition of the accurate simulation flow model; and improvement of the integration of multiscale heterogeneities in reservoir simulation.This work presents a new methodology and analysis that can be useful for multidisciplinary areas.},

The coarse models are in the form of a generalized dual-porosity representation, in which matrix rock and fractures exchange fluid locally while large-scale flow occurs through the fracture network. The methodology developed here introduces local subgrids to resolve dynamics within the matrix and provides appropriate coarse-scale parameters describing fracture-fracture, matrix-fracture, and matrix-matrix flow. The geometry of the local subgrids, as well as the required parameters for the coarse-scale model, are determined from local flow solutions using the underlying discrete fracture model. The method is applied to two- and three-dimensional single-phase and two-phase flow problems, and the accuracy of the coarse models is assessed relative to fully resolved discrete fracture simulations. For the cases considered, it is shown that the technique is capable of generating highly accurate coarse models with many fewer unknowns than the detailed characterizations, and speedups of about a factor of 100 are achieved.},

abstract = {One difficulty in fracture upscaling for field-scale dual-porosity reservoir simulation is the determination of equivalent gridblock fracture permeability, which depends on the type of boundary conditions imposed on the discrete-fracture-network (DFN) simulation. Actually, classical upscaling procedures usually are based on linearly varying pressure boundary conditions, which cannot capture the near-well flow behavior. As a result, the well productivity calculated by a dual-porosity flow simulator can be very different from that calculated on a DFN model. This paper proposes a near-well fracture-upscaling procedure based on the geological DFN model to improve the accuracy of well productivity in fractured-reservoir simulators. This procedure enables us to represent the actual flow through the fractures and the exchanges between matrix and fractures in the well vicinity. On the basis of the computed near-well flow pattern, equivalent fracture transmissibilities as well as numerical well indices are determined and assigned to the gridblocks of the dual-porosity reservoir simulator. The reliability and necessity of using the nearwell upscaling procedure are demonstrated by examples. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract = {A major part of the world's remaining oil reserves is located in fractured carbonate reservoirs, which are dual-porosity (fracture-matrix) or multi-porosity (fracture-vug-matrix) in nature. Fractured reservoirs suffer from poor recovery, high water cut, and generally low performance. They are modelled using a dual-porosity approach, which assumes that the high-permeability fractures are mobile and low-permeability matrix is immobile. A single transfer function models the rate at which hydrocarbons migrate from the matrix into the fractures. As shown in many numerical, laboratory, and field experiments, a wide range of transfer rates occurs between the immobile matrix and mobile fractures. These arise, for example, from the different size of matrix blocks (yielding a distribution of shape factors), different porosity types, or the inhomogeneous distribution of saturations in the matrix blocks. Accurate models are hence needed that capture all the transfer rates between immobile matrix and mobile fracture domains, particularly to predict late-time recovery more reliably when the water cut is already high. In this work we propose a novel multi-rate mass transfer model for two-phase flow, which accounts for viscous dominated flow in the fracture domain and capillary flow in the matrix domain. It extends the classical (i.e., single-rate) dual-porosity model in that it allows us to simulate the wide range of transfer rates occurring in naturally fractured multi-porosity rocks. Using numerical simulations of water-flooding in naturally fractured rock masses at the grid-block scale we demonstrate that our multi-rate mass-transfer model matches the observed recovery curves more accurately compared to the classical dual-porosity model. We further discuss how tracer tests can be used to calibrate our multi-rate dual-porosity model before the water-flood commences and how our model could be employed in commercial reservoir simulation workflows.

Existing methods in this field usually compute fracture connectivity using the average fracture length. This approach is valid for ideally shaped, randomly distributed fractures, but is not immediately applicable to natural fracture networks. In particular, natural networks tend to be more connected than randomly positioned fractures of comparable lengths, since natural fractures often terminate in each other. The proposed topological connectivity measure is based on the number of intersections and fracture terminations per sampling area, which for statistically stationary networks can be obtained directly from limited outcrop exposures. To evaluate the method, numerical permeability upscaling was performed on a large number of synthetic and natural fracture networks, with varying topology and geometry. The proposed method was seen to provide much more reliable permeability estimates than the length-based approach, across a wide range of fracture patterns. We summarize our results in a single, explicit formula for the effective permeability.},

abstract = {The interconnectedness of a subsurface fracture system depends on five fracture and fracture set geometry characteristics: density, orientation, dimensions (height and length), connectivity and aperture. Orientation and density can be determined with some degree of accuracy but the uncertainty ranges associated with the other characteristics will be large. Calibration with dynamic indicators will bring out the hydraulic properties of the network and can help to reduce uncertainty in the geometric characteristics. The fracture network geometry in the inter-well space can be described through geostatistical analysis but more commonly it is derived from seismic data, through edge detection or the analysis and calibration of seismic velocity anisotropy attributes or curvature analysis. Geomechanical analysis is necessary to evaluate the impact on network conductivity of the changing stress state in the reservoir. Using percolation theory, a qualitative assessment can be made of how the conductivity and interconnectedness of the fracture network is developed in terms of network clusters. This integrated analysis of static and dynamic fracture data leads to the formulation of conceptual models and a set of modelling rules. A Digital (Discrete) Fracture Network model, based on these concept(s), rules and inter-well interpolation data, can then be analysed in terms of expected network cluster size, distribution and hydraulics. This provides a control on the expectations embedded in the concepts prior to dynamic modelling. The uncertainties are normally quite large and very seldom will they allow construction of the definitive fracture model. The systematic and integrated analysis of fracture network geometry, constrained with dynamic indicators and subsequent network cluster analysis, are necessary preparatory steps for construction and analysis of dynamic models.},

Where we contribute differently is that we treat large fractures as explicit fractures through EDFM. The small fractures are more amenable to homogenization due to smaller REVs required for them.

abstract = {In fractured reservoirs, data directly related to fractures are scarce and uni-dimensional (i.e. cores and image logs). Other types of data are better distributed and have proved to be related to fracturing but only indirectly (e.g. lithology or large scale structure).In such reservoirs, however, one has to understand fracture distribution and behavior at the field scale. A methodology has been developed within TotalFinaElf to define the relationships of all sources of data to fracturing and to integrate them and compared to another independent published method. To that end, a systematic work flow which goes from 1D to 2D and from static to dynamic data has been defined and various technologies tested.A field case in North Africa is taken to illustrate this methodology. In this field, fracture data from image logs have been related to: 1) production data; 2) 3D seismic attributes (coherency, amplitude, structural curvature) and fault interpretation and strain; 3) log data such as porosity, thickness and lithology index. The former type of data is used to understand the contribution of each fracture set to flow. The latter two types of data are used to better map fracture distribution at the field scale. Ultimately, this mapping is calibrated with the production data of the other wells where fracturing data are not available and is then used to validate the specific role of fracturing in this field. A better reservoir simulation and infill well planning can be subsequently achieved.IntroductionFractured reservoirs are by nature highly heterogeneous. In such reservoirs, fracture systems control permeability and can also control porosity. Fracture modeling is therefore a key development issue and requires an integrated approach from geology to reservoir simulation and well planning. The geometry (i.e. static model) of the fracture network is generally defined from well data (i.e. cores or image logs) using conventional structural geology techniques. Then, fracture permeability can be assessed by relating the fracture aperture to the fracture excess conductivity measured on electrical image logs1 and/or to critically stressed fractures within the present day stress field2. However, it is the authors' opinion that such approaches can only give, in the best case, a relative estimate of the fracture permeability. A quantitative modeling of fracture flow behavior is therefore required (i.e. dynamic model). At the well scale, this can be done by constructing Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN)3-4 through which flow is modeled and which are matched to well test data5. Ultimately, these models can help in determining the fracture parameters required in dual porosity / dual permeability reservoir flow simulation6,7. However, if these DFN models are appropriate for reservoir sector models, their application to full field simulation is somewhat difficult since their extrapolation outside the well scale can be limited by the heterogeneous vertical and lateral distribution of the fracture networks. The modeling of the spatial distribution of fracturing at the scale of the entire field and its calibration to well data is the purpose of this paper.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen a strong increase of research into flows in fractured porous media, mainly related to subsurface processes, but also in materials science and biological applications. Connected fractures totally dominate flow-patterns, and their representation is therefore a critical part in model design. Due to the fracture's characteristics as approximately planar discontinuities with an extreme size to width ratio, they challenge standard macroscale mathematical and numerical modeling of flow based on averaging. Thus, over the last decades, various, and also fundamentally different, approaches have been developed. This paper reviews common conceptual models and discretization approaches for flow in fractured porous media, with an emphasis on the dominating effects the fractures have on flow processes. In this context, the paper discuss the tight connection between physical and mathematical modeling and simulation approaches. Extensions and research challenges related to transport, multi-phase flow and fluid-solid interaction are also commented on.},

However, the relationships between the exponents of both scaling-laws has been poorly investigated. We show theoretically and numerically that the fractal dimension D and the exponent a of the frequency length distribution of fault networks, are related through the relation x=(a-1)/D, where x is the exponent of a new scaling law involving the average distance from a fault to its nearest neighbor of larger length. Measurements of the relevant exponents on the San Andreas fault pattern are in agreement with the theoretical analysis and allows us to test the fragmentation models proposed in the literature. We also found a correlation between the position of a fault and its length so that large faults have their nearest neighbor located at greater distances than small faults. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Geophysical Union},

abstract = {The discrete feature network (DFN) approach offers many key advantages over conventional dual porosity (DP) approaches, particularly when issues of connectivity dominate recovery and reservoir stimulation in fractured and heterogeneous reservoirs. DP models have been developed for complex multiphase and thermal effects, and have been implemented for basin scale modeling. However, DP models address only the dual porosity nature of fractured reservoirs, generally simplifying connectivity and scale-dependent heterogeneity issues which are modeled efficiently and more accurately by the DFN approach. This paper describes the development of techniques to integrate DFN and DP approaches. These techniques allow the analyst to maintain many of the advantages of the DP simulator approach without losing the realism of complex fracture system geometry and connectivity, as captured by DFN models. The techniques described are currently used within a DOE funded research project for linking a DFN and a DP thermal simulation model for the Yates field, Texas. The paper describes some of the geological and engineering aspects of the Yates field and gives two examples of how DP parameters for the thermal simulation can be derived using DFN modeling techniques.},

abstract = {In this article we present some numerical techniques to increase efficiency and applicability of a flow-based upscaling procedure used to solve single and multi-phase flows in naturally fractured reservoirs. These geological formations may be characterized by hundreds up to hundreds of thousands of fractures, ranging from small to medium scales, spreading all over the reservoir. In these scenarios numerical simulations using an explicit discretization of all fractures become rapidly unfeasible. The problem may be overcome by upscaling procedures. In this work we assume that the flow in the reservoir is simulated by using a corner-point grid completely unrelated to the fracture network. The presence of the latter is accounted for by a numerical upscaled procedure that employs an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM). To characterize the scaled up problem, we consider a flow-based upscaling procedure where multiple sub-regions are used to derive transmissibilities, mean depths and pore volumes related to the degrees of freedom associated with fractures and rock matrix. An important aspect of the work with respect to others presented in the literature is the enhancement of the upscaling process by splitting the degrees of freedom associated with unconnected portions of the rock matrix. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We also compare two ways of setting up the boundary conditions of the local problems, that is a well known open issue, used to compute the upscaled transmissibility between cells. Though the experiments lead to a similar result, at the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such a comparison is made for fractured reservoir.},

abstract = {Permeability upscaling should be carried out with careful attention to the nature of rock heterogeneities. While there are many large-scale features which must be taken into account, there are also important heterogeneities at the small-scale. Many sedimentary structures contain laminae at the mm-cm scale, and beds at the m-scale, which give rise to strong contrasts in permeability. We use a 2D model derived from a photo-panel of an aeolian outcrop, along with permeability measurements from a North Sea oil field, to demonstrate the effects of small-scale heterogeneity. This model is similar in size to a typical cell of a reservoir geological model. We take imaginary probe and core plug measurements from the model, average them, and compare these with the effective permeability for the model computed from a finite difference flow calculation. Although this procedure is standard practice, we show that it can lead to biased estimates of the permeabilities used in flow simulation. As an alternative we suggest using models of representative beds, and performing flow simulation to calculate effective permeabilities for both single-phase and two-phase flow.},

abstract = {Transport processes in heterogeneous porous media are often treated in terms of one-equation models. Such treatment assumes that the velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration can be represented in terms of a single large-scale averaged quantity in regions having significantly different mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. In this paper we explore the process of single-phase flow in a two-region model of heterogeneous porous media. The region-averaged equations are developed for the case of a slightly compressible flow which is an accurate representation for a certain class of liquid-phase flows. The analysis leads to a pair of transport equations for the region averaged pressures that are coupled through a classic exchange term, in addition to being coupled by a diffusive cross effect. The domain of validity of the theory has been identified in terms of a series of length and timescale constraints. In Part II the theory is tested, in the absence of adjustable parameters, by comparison with numerical experiments for transient, slightly compressible flow in both stratified and nodular models of heterogeneous porous media. Good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for nodular and stratified systems, and effective transport coefficients for a wide range of conditions are presented on the basis of solutions of the three closure problems that appear in the theory. Part III of this paper deals with the principle of large-scale mechanical equilibrium and the region-averaged form of Darcy's law. This form is necessary for the development and solution of the region-averaged solute transport equations that are presented in Part IV. Finally, in Part V we present results for the dispersion tensors and the exchange coefficient associated with the two-region model of solute transport with adsorption.},

Lithological layering was found to be important and two end-member fracture systems have been identified. In ‘stratabound' systems, fractures are confined to single layers, sizes are scale restricted, and spacing is regular. In ‘non-stratabound systems', fractures show a wide range of sizes (often power-law), are spatially clustered and vertically persistent.

abstract = {Whilst sophisticated multiphase fluid flow models are routinely employed to understand behaviour of oil and gas reservoirs, high-resolution data describing the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of rock characteristics is rarely available to populate models. We present a new approach to developing a quantitative understanding of the effect of individual controls on the distribution of petrophysical properties and their impact on fluid flow. This involves simulating flow through high-detail permeability architectures generated by forward modelling of the coupled depositional-diagenetic evolution of isolated platforms using CARB3D+. This workflow is exemplified by an investigation of interactions between subsidence and climate, and their expression in spatial variations in reservoir quality in an isolated carbonate platform of similar size and subsidence history to the Triassic Latemar Platform. Dissolutional lowering during subaerial exposure controls platform-top graininess via platform top hydrodynamics during the subsequent transgression. Dissolved carbonate is reprecipitated as cements by percolating meteoric waters. However, associated subsurface meteoric dissolution generates significant secondary porosity under a more humid climate. Slower subsidence enhances diagenetic overprinting during repeated exposure events. Single-phase streamline simulations show how early diagenesis develops more permeable fairways within the finer-grained condensed units that can act as thief zones for flow from the grainier but less diagenetically altered cyclic units.},

Severe difficulties common to all methods are discussed: choosing the number and locations of the coarse-grid rock types, defining the simulations from which the pseudos are generated, and the dependence of the pseudos on well rates and positions. It is concluded that, in practice, pseudos cannot be used reliably to scale up from a “fine-grid” geological model to a “coarse-grid” fluid-flow model except for cases where capillary or gravity equilibrium can be assumed at the coarse-gridblock scale. Scaling up from the core scale to the geological model is more likely to be possible because capillary forces are more important at smaller scales. A practical approach to the dynamic upscaling problem is out- lined, but one should not expect that the effects of the detail in the geological model will be captured more than qualitatively.},

abstract = {Accurate geological modelling of features such as faults, fractures or erosion requires grids that are flexible with respect to geometry. Such grids generally contain polyhedral cells and complex grid-cell connectivities. The grid representation for polyhedral grids in turn affects the efficient implementation of numerical methods for subsurface flow simulations. It is well known that conventional two-point flux-approximation methods are only consistent for K-orthogonal grids and will, therefore, not converge in the general case. In recent years, there has been significant research into consistent and convergent methods, including mixed, multipoint and mimetic discretisation methods. Likewise, the so-called multiscale methods based upon hierarchically coarsened grids have received a lot of attention. The paper does not propose novel mathematical methods but instead presents an open-source Matlab{\textregistered} toolkit that can be used as an efficient test platform for (new) discretisation and solution methods in reservoir simulation. The aim of the toolkit is to support reproducible research and simplify the development, verification and validation and testing and comparison of new discretisation and solution methods on general unstructured grids, including in particular corner point and 2.5D PEBI grids. The toolkit consists of a set of data structures and routines for creating, manipulating and visualising petrophysical data, fluid models and (unstructured) grids, including support for industry standard input formats, as well as routines for computing single and multiphase (incompressible) flow. We review key features of the toolkit and discuss a generic mimetic formulation that includes many known discretisation methods, including both the standard two-point method as well as consistent and convergent multipoint and mimetic methods. Apart from the core routines and data structures, the toolkit contains add-on modules that implement more advanced solvers and functionality. Herein, we show examples of multiscale methods and adjoint methods for use in optimisation of rates and placement of wells.},

Well tests and production history indicate that these formations are highly heterogeneous and that significant fluid flow occurs through both the matrix and fracture system. However there remained significant uncertainty about the specific controls and location of the main productivity conduits and how they would influence sweep efficiency during planned water flood. To address these uncertainties a range of possible conceptual fracture models were considered with respect to controls on major flow within the reservoir. Analysis indicated that the reservoir is dominated by a connected series of seismic scale faults acting as major flow conduits with smaller fractures providing a less significant enhancement to matrix permeability. A key input to this study was the examination of over 80 well tests. Simulation of a number of key well tests using a simple discrete fracture network model comprising a connected fault network and pseudo-matrix layer was able to reproduce the majority of the observed pressure derivative shapes. This gave some confidence to the understanding of major reservoir flow paths as well as providing calibrated fault properties for direct inclusion within the simulation model.},

abstract = {Accurate modeling of hydrocarbon production is a necessary, yet challenging step for economic exploitation of unconventional resources. One of the main challenges is to model flow to a horizontal well from a complex network of hydraulic and natural fractures. Many unconventional reservoirs comprise well-developed natural fracture networks with multiple orientations and complex hydraulic fracture patterns based on microseismic data. Conventional dual porosity and dual permeability models are not adequate for modeling these complex networks of natural and hydraulic fractures. Also, it is neither practical nor advantageous to model a large number of pre-existing fractures with a discrete fracture model. Therefore, an appropriate approach to model production from low-permeability reservoirs is to perform discrete fracture modeling for hydraulic fractures and employ a dual continuum approach for numerous natural fractures. We have developed a coupled dual continuum and discrete fracture method to simulate production from unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Large-scale hydraulic fractures (macro-fractures) are modeled explicitly using a discrete fracture model, called EDFM, and numerous small-scale natural fractures (micro-fractures) are modeled using a dual continuum approach. The hybrid model includes three domains: matrix, discrete-fracture, and continuum-fracture domains. A systematic approach is devised to calculate transport parameters between all three domains. Moreover, EDFM allows for not only transverse and longitudinal hydraulic fractures but also macro-fractures of any orientation. Thus, the coupled model provides an effective and reliable environment to improve stimulation designs and completion strategies. We present several examples in this study to show the applicability, robustness, and performance of the hybrid method for the simulation of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. We examine multi-stage hydraulic fractures with multiple configurations in the presence of numerous pre-existing fractures. Simulations show a noticeable contribution from natural fracture networks on total production. Furthermore, for the tight oil reservoir examined in this study, the stimulation scheme with longer hydraulic fractures improves cumulative oil production compared to the scheme with larger number of shorter hydraulic fractures. We also examine production from a tight gas reservoir wherein hydraulic fractures partially penetrate the formation height. Simulations indicate that inefficient fracture treatment can result in significant loss of production.},

abstract = {Advanced characterization methodology and software are now able to$\backslash$nprovide realistic pictures of fracture networks. However these pictures$\backslash$nhave to be validated against dynamic data like flowmeter, well test,$\backslash$ninterference test or production data and calibrated in terms of hydraulic$\backslash$nproperties. This calibration and validation step is based on the$\backslash$nsimulation of these dynamic tests. What has to be overcome is the$\backslash$npossibility to both accurately represent large and complex fracture$\backslash$nnetworks and simulate matrix-fracture exchanges with a minimum number$\backslash$nof grid-blocks. This paper presents an efficient patented solution$\backslash$nto tackle this problem. First, a method derived from the well-known$\backslash$ndual-porosity concept is presented. The approach consists in developing$\backslash$nan optimized explicit representation of the fractured medium and$\backslash$nspecific treatments of matrix-fracture exchanges and matrix-matrix$\backslash$nflows. In this approach, matrix blocks of different volumes and shapes$\backslash$nare associated to each fracture cell depending on the local geometry$\backslash$nof the surrounding fractures. The matrix block geometry is determined$\backslash$nusing a rapid image processing algorithm. The great advantage of$\backslash$nthis approach is to simulate local matrix-fracture exchanges on large$\backslash$nfractured medium in a much faster and appropriate way. Indeed, the$\backslash$nsimulation can be carried out using a much smaller number of cells$\backslash$ncompared to a fully explicit discretization of both matrix and fracture$\backslash$nmedia. The proposed approach presents other advantages due to its$\backslash$ngreat flexibility. Indeed, it accurately handles the cases where$\backslash$nflows are not controlled by fractures alone: either the fracture$\backslash$nnetwork may be not hydraulically connected from one well to another,$\backslash$nor the matrix may have a high permeability in some places. Finally,$\backslash$nwell test cases demonstrate the reliability of the method and its$\backslash$nrange of application.},

abstract = {We argue that most fracture systems are spatially organized according to two main regimes: a “dilute” regime for the smallest fractures, where they can grow independently of each other, and a “dense” regime for which the density distribution is controlled by the mechanical interactions between fractures. We derive a density distribution for the dense regime by acknowledging that, statistically, fractures do not cross a larger one. This very crude rule, which expresses the inhibiting role of large fractures against smaller ones but not the reverse, actually appears be a very strong control on the eventual fracture density distribution since it results in a self‐similar distribution whose exponents and density term are fully determined by the fractal dimension D and a dimensionless parameter $\backslash$gamma that encompasses the details of fracture correlations and orientations. The range of values for D and $\backslash$gamma appears to be extremely limited, which makes this model quite universal. This theory is supported by quantitative data on either fault or joint networks. The transition between the dilute and dense regimes occurs at about a few tenths of a kilometer for faults systems and a few meters for joints. This remarkable difference between both processes is likely due to a large-scale control (localization) of the fracture growth for faulting that does not exist for jointing. Finally, we discuss the consequences of this model on the flow properties and show that these networks are in a critical state, with a large number of nodes carrying a large amount of flow.},

abstract = {One hundred fractured reservoirs from around the world were evaluated to determine how ultimate recovery was affected by inherent reservoir and fluid properties, such as porosity, permeability, viscosity, mobility ratio, Sw, wettability, fracture distribution, and drive mechanism vs the choice of reservoir management strategy, e.g., optimization of production rate and type of EOR technique. Fractured oil reservoirs were divided into four groups. Type I reservoirs have little matrix porosity and permeability. Fractures provide both storage capacity and fluid-flow pathways. Type II reservoirs have low matrix porosity and permeability. Matrix provides some storage capacity and fractures provide the fluid-flow pathways. Type III (microporous) reservoirs have high matrix porosity and low matrix permeability. Matrix provides the storage capacity and fractures provide the fluid-flow pathways. Type IV (macroporous) reservoirs have high matrix porosity and permeability. Matrix provides both storage capacity and fluid- flow pathways, while fractures merely enhance permeability. Previous fractured reservoir classifications did not distinguish between Type II and Type III reservoirs, instead combining all fractured reservoirs with low matrix permeability together into one group. By cross-plotting the various reservoir properties vs ultimate recovery factor and reviewing case studies of primary and enhanced recovery history for 26 Type II and 20 Type III reservoirs, it is demonstrated that recovery factor is controlled by different factors in these two reservoir types. Recovery factor in Type II reservoirs is sensitive to aquifer- drive strength and optimization of flow rate. Type II reservoirs are easily damaged by excessive production rates, but when managed properly, some achieve good recovery without the need for secondary or enhanced recovery programs. Recovery factor in Type III reservoirs is affected by inherent rock and fluid luid properties, particularly matrix permeability, API gravity, wettability, and fracture intensity. The choice of proper EOR technique is essential for optimum exploitation. No Type III reservoir is produced to final depletion without the aid of some type of secondary or EOR technique. Recognition of the differences between Type II and Type III fractured reservoirs should lead to better choices of exploitation strategy.},

abstract = {Many of the sites that have been proposed as potential locations of underground radioactive waste repositories contain fractured rocks. For example, both the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, contain many hydrogeologic units that are extensively fractured [1,2]. When modeling the hydrological behavior of these sites, for either the purpose of site characterization or performance assessment, computational gridblocks are often used that contain large numbers of fractures [3]. In order to treat these gridblocks as equivalent continua, it is necessary to develop a procedure for relating the hydraulic properties of the individual fractures, and the topology of the fracture network, to the overall gridblock-scale permeability [4, 5]. One aspect of this problem is that of determining the in situ hydraulic properties of the individual fractures. Another aspect is to reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of the fracture network based on borehole or outcrop measurements. The final stage in the problem is that of taking a network of known geometry (which may be stochastically generated), and determining its effective gridblock-scale conductivity. The purpose of this paper is to describe a simple procedure for solving this latter problem, and to demonstrate its use in cases of both saturated and unsaturated flow.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) in par- ticular are expected to play a vital role in future energy scenarios. In . order to enhance the efficiency of the power plant, cold working fluid (usually water) is initially injected to increase the conductivity of exist- ing fractures and to create new ones. To model single phase flow and transport in such dynamically changing, highly fractured reservoirs, a new approach is presented and is used for developing an efficient and accurate EGS simulator, i.e. HFR-Sim. It is based on an adaptive hierarchical fracture representation (a-HFR) that results in a network of multiple dominant fractures, through which most of the mass flow occurs. These large fractures have a discrete representation, i.e. each fracture is represented by a lower dimensional continuum. A single continuum representation with appropriate effec- tive properties is also employed for the damaged matrix, which consists of many small and medium sized fractures. The main advantage of the new approach is that no expensive re-meshing of the domain is re- quired, when new fractures are added. Dynamically changing fracture networks can be simulated with a grid that effectively adapts itself to changes. Moreover, tiny volumes that reduce the time-step size are avoided. The a-HFR approach is the cornerstone of the EGS algorithmic frame- work HFR-Sim, designed for EGS simulations of a wide range of prob- lems. HFR-Sim meshes EGS models and solves for flow and trans- port based on a-HFR. It offers communication interfaces for coupling with software that model mechanical and chemical effects, such that thermal-hydro-mechanical-chemical simulations can be performed. HFR-Sim is not yet coupled with geomechanics and geochemical mod- ules. However, it is used for a demonstration scenario that shows how EGS simulations can assist in assessing the potentials of different EGS cycles. Simulations are performed for studying the electrical power production of EGS from classical designs with a deep reservoir and combinations of deep and shallow reservoirs, in which the shallow one acts as a preheater. Modeling flow and heat transport inside fractured rocks is a challenging task. The length scales of the rock discontinuities are many orders of mag- nitude smaller than the rock domain. With conventional discrete fracture models, very fine grids need to be employed and for simulating complex frac- ture geometries very tiny time-steps are required. Here, a result of flow and heat advection in an outcrop of a real fracture network, obtained with the a-HFR approach with larger time-steps for finer matrix grids, is presented. Cold water (blue color) is injected from the left side and pushes out the stored hot water (red color) to the right. Volumes with mean temperature between the two extrema are colored accordingly. A},

In another area of study, researchers study reservoirs that have impermeable matrix and only fractures. A homogenization approach is applied here and this relates to Oda and other authors. In contrast to this, Pal is exploring a homogenization approach for matrix together with fractures.},

abstract = {As part of an ongoing drive to enhance oil recovery from several fractured carbonate reservoirs in Oman, Shell's Carbonate Development Team and Petroleum Development Oman have applied a workflow and research software package aimed at better characterizing the complex subsurface. The workflow comprises several steps, each one supported by a multidisciplinary research program, and implemented in an integrated software environment for application to field development and enhanced oil recovery projects. The software tool, which interacts with the existing Static and Dynamic modeling packages, produces integrated reservoir models including fracture specific information. The capabilities include: (1) Data integration and visualization (2) Constraints definition (from subsurface, analogue outcrops, geomechanics, etc.) (3) {\{}3D{\}} fracture modeling (4) Link to reservoir simulation. The tool is flexible, such that any type of well data {\{}(Static{\}} and Dynamic), seismic data (attributes and interpretations), and constraints can be brought together in a single display. An analysis package allows rapid visual and interactive structural analysis to be made, with quantification of structural elements. Constraints are derived from outcrop and subsurface field examples, geomechanical data and sandbox analogue experiments. A key constraint includes mechanical layering as a control on fracture geometries. Fracture networks are generated following the defined constraints combining statistics and mechanical rules. The fracture network properties useful for the Dynamic simulation can be quickly extracted. Because emphasis is placed on characterization and maximum use of the relevant constraints, the tool helps ensuring that the fracture modeling time is spent on understanding and assessing the uncertainties. To date this workflow has been applied to several fields worldwide, demonstrating its suitability to address problems related to Natural Depletion, Waterflooding or Assisted Steam Gas Oil Gravity Drainage.

For matrix permeabilities of 0.00 1–1 D, the matrix either dominates or contributes significantly to the total flow. The percentage of the flow-normal cross-section that is occupied by fractures, Af, strongly influences the fracture-matrix permeability ratio, above which fractures will dominate flow. This ratio is 102–104 for Af = 104–103 (mean = 5 103), but also depends on the proportion of fractures which fully penetrate the representative elementary volume. Fluid-velocity spectra for the fractured rock have three important characteristics: (1) Darcy velocity is only poorly correlated with permeability, (2) flow velocities have characteristic values, even if fracture-length frequency relations are self similar, and (3) fracture and matrix velocities overlap.},

abstract = {Many naturally fractured reservoirs around the world have depleted significantly and improved oil recovery (IOR) processes are necessary for further development. Hence, the modeling of fractured reservoirs has received increased attention recently. Accurate modeling and simulation of naturally fractured reservoirs is still challenging owing to permeability anisotropies and contrasts. Non-physical abstractions inherent in conventional dual porosity and dual permeability models make them inadequate for solving different fluid-flow problems in fractured reservoirs. Also, recent technologies of discrete fracture modeling suffer from large simulation run times and the industry has not found applications for them yet, even though they give more accurate representations of fractured reservoirs than dual continuum models. We developed a novel discrete fracture model for an in-house compositional reservoir simulator that borrows the dual- medium concept from conventional dual continuum models and also incorporates the effect of each fracture explicitly. In contrast to dual continuum models, fractures have arbitrary orientations and can be angled or vertical, honoring the complexity of a typical fractured reservoir. Likewise, the new discrete fracture model does not need mesh refinement around fractures and offers computationally-efficient simulations compared to other discrete fracture models. Examples of water-flooding and gas injection are presented in this paper to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and applicability of the developed model for studying IOR processes in naturally fractured reservoirs. Simulations show that favorable rock wettability along with capillary pressure contrasts between matrix and fractures causes noticeable incremental oil recovery in water floods. Likewise, simulations of gas injection demonstrate that high-permeability fractures not only expedite gas breakthrough, but also increase segregation of gas towards the top of the reservoir, leading to very low sweep efficiency. Furthermore, oil recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs is found to be sensitive to the fracture inclination angle.},

@article{Hui2013,
abstract = {Abstract Improved and enhanced oil recovery (IOR/EOR) processes, such gas injection and waterflooding, are difficult to model accurately in fractured reservoirs due to complicated multiphase physics and the strong property contrast between permeable natural fractures and tight matrix rock. Traditionally, fractured reservoirs are modeled using coarse dual-porosity (DP) simulation models that idealize the fracture system. Consequently, important recovery physics can be missed, causing misleading flow predictions. We present an unstructured discrete-fracture-matrix (DFM) approach for three-phase, fully compositional simulations of IOR/EOR processes. We generate detailed DFM grids that represent several thousand realistic discrete fractures and different well configurations. These grids are then discretized for IOR/EOR flow simulations. We apply the flow-based multiple subregion (MSR) technique with two subregions to generate unstructured coarse-scale fracture models that are directly based on the DFM sector models. We next employ MSR upscaling to create corresponding structured DFM-based dual-porosity, dual-permeability (DPDK) models, computing parameters like shape factors and effective fracture permeabilities. We lastly generate conventional DPDK models by invoking simplifying assumptions and analytical equations. Using DFM results as reference solutions, we find the following order of decreasing accuracy: MSR, DFM-based DPDK, and conventional DPDK models. The DPDK models result in significant inaccuracies at individual wells when important fluid movement (e.g., gas breakthrough) is missed. The errors at sector scale are lower due to cancellation of errors at wells. The simulation results indicate that oil recovery and injected fluid breakthrough behavior are a complicated function of the reservoir heterogeneity, well configurations, and phase behavior. Large modeling errors can potentially lead to the selection of a sub-optimal injectant. One to two orders of computational speedup are achieved from the upscaling. These findings point to the need for systematic upscaling of realistic DFM representations to generate fast and accurate coarse fracture models for the assessment of field-development IOR/EOR schemes.},

abstract = {Naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR), such as the large carbonate reservoirs in the Middle East, contain a major part of the world's remaining conventional oil reserves, but recover-ing these is especially challenging as the fractures only constitute fluid conduits while the oil is trapped in a low-permeability rock matrix. Recovery factors are therefore difficult to estimate, per-meability anisotropy is high, size and shape of drainage areas are difficult to constrain, early water breakthrough is likely to be associated with a high and irreversible water cut, and secondary recov-ery behaviour is unusual. Outcrop-analogue model-based discrete fracture and matrix (DFM) simu-lations have emerged recently, helping us to disentangle and rationalize this erratic production behaviour. They allow us to understand the emergent flow behaviour and resulting saturation patterns in NFRs. Thus, classical simulation approaches, such as dual-continua conceptualiz-ations, can be critically evaluated and improved where they fail to capture the flow behaviour of interest. This paper discusses recent advances in DFM simulation of single-and multi-phase flow pro-cesses in geologically realistic outcrop-analogue models, and solved with finite-element (FE) and finite-volume (FV) methods. It also reviews key results from recent DFM simulation studies, in particular how new measures such as the fracture–matrix flux ratio and velocity spectra can provide new means to analyse flow behaviour in heterogeneous domains or how results from outcrop-based simulations can be used to test the suitability of conventional upscaling approaches for NFR and guide the development of new ones. We close by enlisting outstanding challenges in outcrop-based flow simulations such as the need to capture the fracture–matrix transfer processes due to capillary, gravity and viscous forces accurately, which often implies detailed grid refine-ment at the fracture– matrix interface and small time-steps to resolve the physical processes ade-quately. Thus, we explore how outcrop-based flow simulation could be applied more routinely in NFR reservoir characterization and simulation workflows.},

abstract = {A numerical procedure to determine the equivalent permeability tensor of a fractured rock is presented, using a stochastic REV (Representative Elementary Volume) concept that uses multiple realizations of stochastic DFN (Discrete Fracture Network) models. Ten square DFN models are generated using the Monte Carlo simulations of the fracture system based on the data obtained from a site characterization program at Sellafield, Cumbria, UK. Smaller models with varying sizes of from 0.25 m0.25 m to 10 m10 m are extracted from the generated DFN models and are used as two-dimensional geometrical models for calculation of equivalent permeability tensor. The DFN models are also rotated in 30{\textordmasculine} intervals to evaluate the tensor characteristics of calculated directional permeability. Results show that the variance of the calculated permeability values decreases significantly as the side lengths of the DFN models increase, which justifies the existence of a REV. The REV side length found in this analysis is about 5 m and 8 m with 20{\%} and 10{\%} acceptable variations, respectively. The calculated directional permeability values at the REV size have tensor characteristic that is confirmed by a close approximation of an ellipse in a polar plot of the reciprocal of square roots of the directional permeability.},
annote = {Takeaways:
Fisher distribution to describe orientation variations
Fractal concept leads to length distribution (characterised by fractal dimension)
Fracture locations determined by Poisson point process (density comes into play here)

Generated DFN vs region of analysis needs to be sufficiently big in size contrast (boundary effect)

When calculating perm tensor, need to ensure that our domain is sized according to REV to ensure that:
perm tensor has tensor quality (rotation valid)
perm tensor is probably correct (low coefficient of variation)},

A number of solution strategies are compared, including a vertex and a cell-centered finite volume method, a non-conforming embedded discrete fracture model, a primal and a dual extended finite element formulation, and a mortar discrete fracture model. The proposed benchmarks test the schemes by increasing the difficulties in terms of network geometry, e.g. intersecting fractures, and physical parameters, e.g. low and high fracture-matrix permeability ratio as well as heterogeneous fracture permeabilities. For each problem, the results presented by the participants are the number of unknowns, the approximation errors in the porous matrix and in the fractures with respect to a reference solution, and the sparsity and condition number of the discretized linear system. All data and meshes used in this study are publicly available for further comparisons.},

abstract = {Fractures in subsurface reservoirs are known to have significant impacts on reservoir productivity. Quantifying their importance, however, is challenged by limited subsurface observations, and intense computations for modelling and upscaling. In this paper, we present a workflow to construct and upscale fracture models based on outcrop studies in the Latemar carbonate platform (northern Italy). Fractures were first analysed to investigate their distinct characteristics throughout different sedimentological domains; that is, slope, margin and platform interior. Several fracture models were then built to represent different domains and were used to upscale fracture-network properties. Small-scale models were preferred to the reservoir-scale ones to enable multiple realizations and various sensitivity analyses in a time-efficient manner. The fracture characteristics of the Latemar Platform vary across different sedimentological domains. This variation results in a non-homogeneous permeability field that will influence flow behaviours. Fractures in the slope domain are typically tall but low in intensity, resulting in relatively low effective permeabilities. In the platform interior, smaller sizes of fractures combined with higher intensities give rise to higher effective permeabilities. In general, fracture intensities, aperture and their intrinsic permeability would have a significant impact on the permeability field. Fracture shape and orientations are more important in affecting the connectivity.},

abstract = {This work evaluates and improves upon existing effective medium methods for permeability upscaling in fractured media. Specifically, we are concerned with the asymmetric self-consistent, symmetric self-consistent, and differential methods. In effective medium theory, inhomogeneity is modeled as ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in the rock matrix. Fractured media correspond to the limiting case of flat ellipsoids, for which we derive a novel set of simplified formulas. The new formulas have improved numerical stability properties, and require a smaller number of input parameters. To assess their accuracy, we compare the analytical permeability predictions with three-dimensional finite-element simulations. We also compare the results with a semi-analytical method based on percolation theory and curve-fitting, which represents an alternative upscaling approach. A large number of cases is considered, with varying fracture aperture, density, matrix/fracture permeability contrast, orientation, shape, and number of fracture sets. The differential method is seen to be the best choice for sealed fractures and thin open fractures. For high-permeable, connected fractures, the semi-analytical method provides the best fit to the numerical data, whereas the differential method breaks down. The two self-consistent methods can be used for both unconnected and connected fractures, although the asymmetric method is somewhat unreliable for sealed fractures. For open fractures, the symmetric method is generally the more accurate for moderate fracture densities, but only the asymmetric method is seen to have correct asymptotic behavior. The asymmetric method is also surprisingly accurate at predicting percolation thresholds.},

abstract = {This work presents a new discrete fracture model, namely the Projection-based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (pEDFM). Similar to the existing EDFM approach, pEDFM constructs independent grids for the matrix and fracture domains, and delivers strictly conservative velocity fields. However, as a significant step forward, it is able to accurately model the effect of fractures with general conductivity contrasts relative to the matrix, including impermeable flow barriers. This is achieved by automatically adjusting the matrix transmissibility field, in accordance to the conductivity of neighboring fracture networks, alongside the introduction of additional matrix-fracture connections. The performance of pEDFM is investigated extensively for two- and three-dimensional scenarios involving single-phase as well as multiphase flows. These numerical experiments are targeted at determining the sensitivity of the model towards the fracture position within the matrix control volume, grid resolution and the conductivity contrast towards the matrix. The pEDFM significantly outperforms the original EDFM and produces results comparable to those obtained when using DFM on unstructured grids, therefore proving to be a flexible model for field-scale simulation of flow in naturally fractured reservoirs.},

abstract = {A method to represent fracture networks as grid cell conductivities in a continuum model is described and evaluated. The method is developed for a sparsely fractured rock with a conductivity field that is dominated by major fractures and fracture zones. For such a fracture system it is believed that an accurate description of the correlation and anisotropy structure is essential. The proposed method will capture these features of the fracture system. The basic approach of the method is to evaluate accurate cell conductivity values for a staggered grid arrangement, i.e. velocities are stored at cell walls and scalars at cell centres. The balance of forces, i.e. the Darcy law, is evaluated for a control volume centred around the point where the velocity component is stored. Fractures are assumed to have a thickness and conductivity. The conductivity of a velocity control volume is calculated from the intersecting volume between the fracture and the velocity control volume. Intersecting volumes, with their respective conductivities, are added up to form the control volume conductivity. The general conclusion is that the method results in accurate simulations. It is expected that the method can be utilised in many practical groundwater simulations. This statement is based on the results from three test cases with analytical solution and one test case where results are compared with those from established theories. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Over the matrix domain, the coefficients are scaled by a parameter E representing the size of the matrix blocks. This scaling preserves the physics of the flow in the matrix as E tends to zero. An effective macroscopic limit model is obtained that includes the usual Darcy equations in the matrix blocks and a similar equation for the fracture system that contains a term representing a source of fluid from the matrix.

abstract = {Discrete fracture models are an attractive alternative to upscaled models for flow in fractured media, as they provide a more accurate representation of the flow characteristics. A major challenge in dis- crete fracture simulation is to overcome the large computational cost associated with resolving the individ- ual fractures in large-scale simulations. In this work, two characteristics of the fractured porous media are utilized to construct efficient preconditioners for the discretized flow equations. First, the preconditioners are tailored to the fracture geometry and presumed flow properties so that the dominant features are well represented there. This assures good scalability of the preconditioners in terms of problem size and perme- ability contrast. For fracture dominated problems, numerical examples show that such geometric precondi- tioners are comparable or preferable when compared to state-of-the-art algebraic multigrid preconditioners. The robustness of the physics-based preconditioner for less favorable fracture conditions is further demonstrated by a systematic degradation of the fracture hierarchy. Second, the preconditioners are physics preserving in the sense that conservative fluxes can be computed even for an inexact pressure solutions. This facilitates a scheme where accuracy in the linear solver can be traded for efficiency by termi- nating the iterative solvers based on error estimates, and without sacrificing basic physical modeling princi- ples. With the combination of these two properties a novel preconditioner is obtained which bridges the gap between multiscale approximations and iterative linear solvers. 1.},

abstract = {Based on a detailed structural study performed on a reservoir surface analogue, a fracture permeability model for carbonate reservoirs is proposed. This involves four hierarchical systems, each one assumed to convey fluids exclusively to that of immediately higher order. New basic equations are then provided, simulating hydrodynamic reservoir response. The large scale, first-order structures consist of faults, to which high-permeability structures (damage zones) are associated. At the meter scale, stratabound joint systems, together with bedding joints bounding the mechanical layers, form a connected network transporting fluids to the fault system. At a lower scale, down to crystal size, non-stratabound joints constitute a pervasive and capillary fracture network which conveys fluids within the rock mass. The non-fractured host rock constitutes the lower permeability system (at the crystal scale). As no published works include an effective integration of detailed structural and numerical models, the present study aims at covering a significant gap in the literature, also providing appropriate theoretical basis for subsequent studies on fracture network modeling and reservoir simulation. Besides its application in the field of reservoir development and management, the illustrated model may also be useful in environmental studies involving ground fluids such as e.g. in the field of special/toxic/nuclear waste management.},

abstract = {The equivalent permeability, keq of stratified fractured porous rocks and its anisotropy is important for hydrocarbon reservoir engineering, groundwater hydrology, and subsurface contaminant transport. However, it is difficult to constrain this tensor property as it is strongly influenced by infrequent large fractures. Boreholes miss them and their directional sampling bias affects the collected geostatistical data. Samples taken at any scale smaller than that of interest truncate distributions and this bias leads to an incorrect characterization and property upscaling. To better understand this sampling problem, we have investigated a collection of outcrop-data-based Discrete Fracture and Matrix (DFM) models with mechanically constrained fracture aperture distributions, trying to establish a useful Representative Elementary Volume (REV). Finite-element analysis and flow-based upscaling have been used to determine keq eigenvalues and anisotropy. While our results indicate a convergence toward a scale-invariant keq REV with increasing sample size, keq magnitude can have multi-modal distributions. REV size relates to the length of dilated fracture segments as opposed to overall fracture length. Tensor orientation and degree of anisotropy also converge with sample size. However, the REV for keq anisotropy is larger than that for keq magnitude. Across scales, tensor orientation varies spatially, reflecting inhomogeneity of the fracture patterns. Inhomogeneity is particularly pronounced where the ambient stress selectively activates late- as opposed to early (through-going) fractures. While we cannot detect any increase of keq with sample size as postulated in some earlier studies, our results highlight a strong keq anisotropy that influences scale dependence.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to test an upscaling technique, applied to naturally fractured reservoirs by adjusting fractured block components according to a small-scale fracture behavior using mini-models. The methodology is applied to six cases. For the first two cases, the flow is controlled by thin, high-permeability facies and tectonic fractures (nearly vertical); for the next two cases, the flow is controlled by touching vugs (nearly horizontal) and tectonic fractures and, for the last two cases, the flow is controlled only by touching vugs. Two types of background matrix were tested: those having significant petrophysical features of carbonate reservoirs (separate vugs and textural features) and a homogeneous matrix to validate the fracture upscaling and isolate the matrix heterogeneities effects. A fine-grid cell size of 0.8×0.8×0.4m3 is used as a reference for the upscaling method. All fractured grid blocks in coarser cell size were adjusted to calibrate the fracture direction according to our fine-grid fracture behavior, combined with a well-index adjustment. It was possible to adjust reservoir output parameters (field average and well pressure, oil recovery factor, etc.) and reduce flow simulation time from days to a few seconds. This approach is useful for carrying meso-scale heterogeneities from different sources into a macro-scale grid-cell size, especially when being applied near wells in order to improve the accuracy of well productivity from fractures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Compositional reservoir simulation plays a vital role in the development of conventional and unconventional reservoirs. Two major building blocks of compositional simulation are phase behavior and fluid transport computations. The oil and gas reserves and flow of reservoir fluids are strongly dependent on phase behavior. In conventional reservoirs, capillary pressure is relatively small and is typically ignored in phase behavior calculations. However, large capillary pressure values are encountered in tight formations such as shales; and therefore, its effects should not be ignored in phase equilibria calculations. Neglecting the effects of capillary pressure on phase behavior can lead to an inaccurate estimation of original oil and gas in place as well as recovery performance. In spite of this, the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior in tight reservoirs has not been well studied using compositional simulation, especially for hydraulically-fractured reservoirs. In this paper, we develop a new compositional reservoir simulator capable of modeling discrete fractures and incorporating the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior. Large-scale natural and hydraulic fractures in tight rocks and shales are modeled with a technique called Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) where fractures are modeled explicitly without using local grid refinement or an unstructured grid. Flow of hydrocarbons occurs simultaneously within similar and different porosity types. Capillary pressure is considered in both flow and flash calculations, where simulations also include variable pore size as a function of gas saturation in each grid block. We examine the impact of capillary pressure on the original oil in place and cumulative oil production for different initial reservoir pressures (above and below the bubble-point pressure) on Bakken and Eagle Ford fluids. The importance of capillary pressure on both flow and flash calculations from hydraulically fractured horizontal wells during primary depletion in fractured tight reservoirs using Bakken fluid composition is demonstrated. Phase behavior calculations show that bubble-point pressure is suppressed allowing the production to remain in the single-phase region for a longer period of time and altering phase compositions and fluid properties such as density and viscosity of equilibrium liquid and vapor. The results show that bubble-point suppression is larger in the Eagle Ford shale than for Bakken. When capillary pressure is considered, we found an increase in original oil in place up to 4.1{\%} for Bakken and 46.33{\%} for the Eagle Ford crude. Depending on the initial reservoir pressure, cumulative primary production after one year increases owing to capillary pressure by approximately 9.0-38.2{\%} for Bakken oil and 7.2-154{\%} for Eagle Ford oil. The recovery increase caused by capillary pressure becomes more significant when reservoir pressure is far below bubble-point pressure. The simulation results with hydraulically fractured wells give similar recovery differences; cumulative oil production after 1 year is 3.5-5.2{\%} greater when capillary pressure is considered in phase behavior calculations for Bakken.},

abstract = {A simplified discrete-fracture model suitable for use with general-purpose reservoir simulators is presented. The model handles both 2- and 3D systems and includes fracture-fracture, matrix-fracture, and matrix-matrix connections. The formulation applies an unstructured control volume finite-difference technique with a two-point flux approximation. The implementation is generally compatible with any simulator that represents grid connections by a connectivity list. A specialized treatment based on a "star-delta" transformation is introduced to eliminate control volumes at fracture intersections. These control volumes would otherwise act to reduce numerical stability and timestep size. The performance of the method is demonstrated for several oil/water flow cases including a simple 2D system, a more complex 3D fracture network, a localized fractured region with strong capillary pressure effects, and a model of a strike-slip fault zone. The discrete-fracture model is shown to provide results in close agreement with those of a reference finite-difference simulator in cases in which direct comparisons are possible.},

abstract = {The discrete feature network (DFN) approach offers many key advantages over conventional dual porosity (DP) approaches, particularly when issues of connectivity dominate recovery and reservoir stimulation in fractured and heterogeneous reservoirs. DP models have been developed for complex multiphase and thermal effects, and have been implemented for basin scale modeling. However, DP models address only the dual porosity nature of fractured reservoirs, generally simplifying connectivity and scale-dependent heterogeneity issues which are modeled efficiently and more accurately by the DFN approach. This paper describes the development of techniques to integrate DFN and DP approaches. These techniques allow the analyst to maintain many of the advantages of the DP simulator approach without losing the realism of complex fracture system geometry and connectivity, as captured by DFN models. The techniques described are currently used within a DOE funded research project for linking a DFN and a DP thermal simulation model for the Yates field, Texas. The paper describes some of the geological and engineering aspects of the Yates field and gives two examples of how DP parameters for the thermal simulation can be derived using DFN modeling techniques.},

Structure grids are applied in the simulation to divide reservoir regions, fracture grids are embedded in matrix grids, and reference nodes are chosen to define the exchanges between fracture and two sides of matrix. During solving the matrix equations, the discontinuities of phase saturations also lead to difficulties for defining the physical quantities on the matrix grids covering fracture, and to avoid this difficulty, inner boundary is used to replace these matrix grids in the computations. This model is used to simulate the reservoirs with straight and inclined fractures, and compared with discrete fracture model and embedded fracture model.

abstract = {In this paper, we derive an a-posteriori error indicator for the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) framework. This error indicator is further used to develop an adaptive enrichment algorithm for the linear elliptic equation with multiscale high-contrast coefficients. The GMsFEM, which has recently been introduced in [13], allows solving multiscale parameter-dependent problems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a reduced-order representation of the solution on a coarse grid. The main idea of the method consists of (1) the construction of snapshot space, (2) the construction of the offline space, and (3) the construction of the online space (the latter for parameter-dependent problems). In [13], it was shown that the GMsFEM provides a flexible tool to solve multiscale problems with a complex input space by generating appropriate snapshot, offline, and online spaces. In this paper, we study an adaptive enrichment procedure and derive an a-posteriori error indicator which gives an estimate of the local error over coarse grid regions. We consider two kinds of error indicators where one is based on the L2-norm of the local residual and the other is based on the weighted H -1-norm of the local residual where the weight is related to the coefficient of the elliptic equation. We show that the use of weighted H -1-norm residual gives a more robust error indicator which works well for cases with high contrast media. The convergence analysis of the method is given. In our analysis, we do not consider the error due to the fine-grid discretization of local problems and only study the errors due to the enrichment. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the robustness of the proposed error indicators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Field observations have revealed that the diffusion properties of fractured materials are strongly influenced by the presence of fractures. Using power law fracture length and fracture permeability distributions currently observed on natural fractured networks, we model the equivalent permeability of two-dimensional (2D) discrete fracture networks by using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments. We first give the dependence of the network equivalent permeability, obtained at the scale of the network, on the characteristic power law exponents of the fracture length and fracture permeability distributions. We especially show that the equivalent permeability depends simply on the geometrical mean of the local fracture permeability distribution. Such networks are characterized by an increase of permeability with scale without limitations, provided that the fracture length and fracture permeability distributions are broad enough. Although a correlation length cannot be systematically defined, the flow structure is still characterized by simple properties. The flow is either extremely channeled in one dominant path or distributed in several separated structures. We show finally that the observed scale effects and flow structure are very different from the one obtained in the lognormal fracture permeability distribution case.},

abstract = {This work presents a new discrete fracture model, namely the Projection-based Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (pEDFM). Similar to the existing EDFM approach, pEDFM constructs independent grids for the matrix and fracture domains, and delivers strictly conservative velocity fields. However, as a significant step forward, it is able to accurately model the effect of fractures with general conductivity contrasts relative to the matrix, including impermeable flow barriers. This is achieved by automatically adjusting the matrix transmissibility field, in accordance to the conductivity of neighboring fracture networks, alongside the introduction of additional matrix-fracture connections. The performance of pEDFM is investigated extensively for two- and three-dimensional scenarios involving single-phase as well as multiphase flows. These numerical experiments are targeted at determining the sensitivity of the model towards the fracture position within the matrix control volume, grid resolution and the conductivity contrast towards the matrix. The pEDFM significantly outperforms the original EDFM and produces results comparable to those obtained when using DFM on unstructured grids, therefore proving to be a flexible model for field-scale simulation of flow in naturally fractured reservoirs.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen a strong increase of research into flows in fractured porous media, mainly related to subsurface processes, but also in materials science and biological applications. Connected fractures totally dominate flow-patterns, and their representation is therefore a critical part in model design. Due to the fracture's characteristics as approximately planar discontinuities with an extreme size to width ratio, they challenge standard macroscale mathematical and numerical modeling of flow based on averaging. Thus, over the last decades, various, and also fundamentally different, approaches have been developed. This paper reviews common conceptual models and discretization approaches for flow in fractured porous media, with an emphasis on the dominating effects the fractures have on flow processes. In this context, the paper discuss the tight connection between physical and mathematical modeling and simulation approaches. Extensions and research challenges related to transport, multi-phase flow and fluid-solid interaction are also commented on.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new model for pressure transient and derivative analysis for multi-porosity reservoirs that have a distribution of matrix block sizes. To highlight the effect of varying fracture spacing, this model uses matrix domain storativity parameters instead of the fracture storativity parameter introduced by Warren and Root. Unlike existing multi-porosity models, it provides a simple expression for the pressure transient response in the time domain. The paper also presents a method for determining shape factors for the different matrix domains of multi-porosity reservoirs that is based on measured fracture spacing distributions. For an example reservoir studied, the pressure transient response for double-porosity reservoirs was found to be very similar to that of triple- or quadruple-porosity reservoirs, as long as the volume fractions of the matrix domains for each respective model were equal. Because of this, multi-porosity models may not provide significantly more information about the reservoir than the simpler double-porosity models. The transition period began somewhat earlier and ended later when more matrix domains were included in the model. When the volume fractions for the different matrix domains were significantly different, the calculated pressure transient response was impacted.},

abstract = {An iterative multiscale finite volume (i-MSFV) method is devised for the simulation of multiphase flow in fractured porous media in the context of a hierarchical fracture modeling framework. Motivated by the small pressure change inside highly conductive fractures, the fully coupled system is split into smaller systems, which are then sequentially solved. This splitting technique results in only one additional degree of freedom for each connected fracture network appearing in the matrix system. It can be interpreted as an agglomeration of highly connected cells; similar as in algebraic multigrid methods. For the solution of the resulting algebraic system, an i-MSFV method is introduced. In addition to the local basis and correction functions, which were previously developed in this framework, local fracture functions are introduced to accurately capture the fractures at the coarse scale. In this multiscale approach there exists one fracture function per network and local domain, and in the coarse scale problem there appears only one additional degree of freedom per connected fracture network. Numerical results are presented for validation and verification of this new iterative multiscale approach for fractured porous media, and to investigate its computational efficiency. Finally, it is demonstrated that the new method is an effective multiscale approach for simulations of realistic multiphase flows in fractured heterogeneous porous media. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Computer programming experience in Fortran is also useful. While percolation is treated as a fundamentally physical concept, its relevance to various natural and living systems is addressed.

@article{Geiger2013,
abstract = {A major part of the world's remaining oil reserves is located in fractured carbonate reservoirs, which are dual-porosity (fracture-matrix) or multi-porosity (fracture-vug-matrix) in nature. Fractured reservoirs suffer from poor recovery, high water cut, and generally low performance. They are modelled using a dual-porosity approach, which assumes that the high-permeability fractures are mobile and low-permeability matrix is immobile. A single transfer function models the rate at which hydrocarbons migrate from the matrix into the fractures. As shown in many numerical, laboratory, and field experiments, a wide range of transfer rates occurs between the immobile matrix and mobile fractures. These arise, for example, from the different size of matrix blocks (yielding a distribution of shape factors), different porosity types, or the inhomogeneous distribution of saturations in the matrix blocks. Accurate models are hence needed that capture all the transfer rates between immobile matrix and mobile fracture domains, particularly to predict late-time recovery more reliably when the water cut is already high. In this work we propose a novel multi-rate mass transfer model for two-phase flow, which accounts for viscous dominated flow in the fracture domain and capillary flow in the matrix domain. It extends the classical (i.e., single-rate) dual-porosity model in that it allows us to simulate the wide range of transfer rates occurring in naturally fractured multi-porosity rocks. Using numerical simulations of water-flooding in naturally fractured rock masses at the grid-block scale we demonstrate that our multi-rate mass-transfer model matches the observed recovery curves more accurately compared to the classical dual-porosity model. We further discuss how tracer tests can be used to calibrate our multi-rate dual-porosity model before the water-flood commences and how our model could be employed in commercial reservoir simulation workflows.

@article{Moinfar2013c,
abstract = {Two discrete-fracture models (DFMs) based on different, independent numerical techniques have been developed for studying the behavior of naturally fractured reservoirs. One model is based on unstructured gridding with local refinement near fractures, while in the second model fractures are embedded in a structured matrix grid. Both models capture the complexity of a typical fractured reservoir better than conventional dual-permeability models, leading to a more accurate representation of fractured reservoirs. The accuracy of the DFM approaches is confirmed by their match with a structured, grid-aligned, explicit-fracture model in tests involving capillary imbibition during water flooding and gravity drainage in oil-gas systems. The DFMs are insensitive to grid orientation. Simulations also show consistency and agreement of results of the DFM methods in synthetic models with complex fracture patterns. Our simulations indicate that conventional dual-permeability approaches are appropriate when the fracture system is very sparse relative to the grid spacing. In these situations a DFM can be used as the basis for defining dual-permeability model parameters. However, conventional dual-permeability approaches are inadequate in the presence of high localized anisotropy and preferential channeling. When used with general purpose reservoir simulators, both DFMs show computational performance that is comparable to that of dual-permeability models.},

abstract = {Fracture patterns are characterized by a complex geometry which involves a large length distribution and nonhomogeneous density distributions. Here we address the issue of the modeling of this complex geometry over scales through a first-order model providing the characterization of the number of fractures of a given length and at a given scale. We propose that the simplest model is a power law in both space and fracture length, with three main parameters: the exponent a of a power law length distribution, the fractal dimension D which fixes the scale dependence of the number of fractures, and the fracture density $\alpha$. We verify the applicability of this model on seven fracture patterns mapped from the metric scale up to almost the kilometric scale in the Hornelen basin. The model efficiently describes fracture network properties at all scales with a single set of parameters. For the Hornelen fracture networks we found a simple relationship between basic exponents, a = D + 1, implying that the fracture network is self-similar. Through this analysis, we present different methodological developments for deriving the basic exponents a and D and for verifying the consistency of the model. Overall, the main methodological development is about the normalization of the measurements made from different scales of observation. Finally, we discuss both the limitations and the uses of such a model for analyzing the hydraulic and mechanical properties of fracture networks.},

abstract = {Matrix-fracture transfer functions are the backbone of any dual-porosity or dual-permeability formulation. The chief feature within them is the accurate definition of shape factors. To date, there is no completely accepted definition of matrix-fracture transfer function. Many definitions of shape factors for instantly-filled fractures with uniform pressure distribution have been presented and used; however, they differ by up to five orders of magnitude. Based on a recently presented definition of transfer function, time-dependent shape factors for pressure driven flow and for water imbibition are proposed. Also new matrix-fracture transfer pressure-based shape factors for instantly-filled fractures with non-uniform pressure distribution are presented in this paper. These are the boundary conditions for a case for porous media with clusters of parallel and disconnected fractures, for instance. These new pressure-based shape factors were obtained by solving the pressure diffusivity equation using non-uniform boundary conditions. This leads to time-dependent shape factors because of the transient part of the solution for pressure. However, approximating the solution with an exponential function, one obtains constant shape factors that can be easily implemented in current dual-porosity reservoir simulators. They provide good results for systems where the transient behavior of pressure is short (a case commonly encountered in fractured reservoirs).},

abstract = {We previously showed that the validation of fracture network models generated using discrete fracture network (DFN) approach through multi-well pressure transient data had certain limitations. In this paper, we tested other approaches used for modeling fracture networks: single porosity (SP) and dual porosity/permeability (DK), which are more common models for dynamic simulation than the DFN models. Multi-well pressure transient and tracer tests were used to validate the fracture network models generated as DFN and converted to grid based SP and DK models using static data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to clarify the effects of fracture permeability, tracer dispersion, matrix-fracture interaction and other terms on tracer performance. Finally, a comparative analysis was performed to critically assess the reliability of different fracture network representations. The data obtained from the Midale field, Canada, was used in this exercise.Even though single or multi-well pressure transient tests are frequently used as an input for fracture network (or permeability map) generation and for the hydraulic calibration of discrete fracture network models, such tests provide limited information about the topology of fracture networks, i.e. connectivity and orientation. Tracer testing was suggested as a richer source of information about reservoir heterogeneity, especially in capturing fracture trends and orientation. The DK model was capable of satisfactorily modeling the pressure interference test in the validation process. However, it did not demonstrate the same accuracy for the tracer test simulation even though only the DK model was able to provide some meaningful match to the tracer tests. The major disagreement between the real and simulated tracer test response was the network connectivity. The limitations of this modeling approach were discussed in terms of representing the connectivity of the fracture network accurately. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Two discrete-fracture models (DFMs) based on different, independent numerical techniques have been developed for studying the behavior of naturally fractured reservoirs. One model is based on unstructured gridding with local refinement near fractures, while in the second model fractures are embedded in a structured matrix grid. Both models capture the complexity of a typical fractured reservoir better than conventional dual-permeability models, leading to a more accurate representation of fractured reservoirs. The accuracy of the DFM approaches is confirmed by their match with a structured, grid-aligned, explicit-fracture model in tests involving capillary imbibition during water flooding and gravity drainage in oil-gas systems. The DFMs are insensitive to grid orientation. Simulations also show consistency and agreement of results of the DFM methods in synthetic models with complex fracture patterns. Our simulations indicate that conventional dual-permeability approaches are appropriate when the fracture system is very sparse relative to the grid spacing. In these situations a DFM can be used as the basis for defining dual-permeability model parameters. However, conventional dual-permeability approaches are inadequate in the presence of high localized anisotropy and preferential channeling. When used with general purpose reservoir simulators, both DFMs show computational performance that is comparable to that of dual-permeability models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider an approach for estimating the effective hydraulic conductivity of a 3-D medium with a binary distribution of local hydraulic conductivities. The medium heterogeneity is represented by a combination of matrix medium conductivity with spatially distributed sets of inclusions. Estimation of effective conductivity is based on a self-consistent approach introduced by Shvidler [1985]. The tensor of effective hydraulic conductivity is calculated numerically by using a simple system of equations for the main diagonal elements. Verification of the method is done by comparison with theoretical results for special cases and numerical results of Desbarats [1987] and our own numerical modeling. The method was applied to estimating the effective hydraulic conductivity of a 2-D and 3-D fractured porous medium. The medium heterogeneity is represented by a combination of matrix conductivity and a spatially distributed set of highly conductive fractures. The tensor of effective hydraulic conductivity is calculated for parallel- and random-oriented sets of fractures. The obtained effective conductivity values coincide with Romm's [1966] and Snow's [1969] theories for infinite fracture length. These values are also physically acceptable for the sparsely fractured medium case with low fracture spatial density and finite fracture length. Verification of the effective hydraulic conductivity obtained for a fractured porous medium is done by comparison with our own numerical modeling for a 3-D case and with Malkovsky and Pek's [1995] results for a 2-D case.},

abstract = {Discrete fracture network (DFN) and stochastic continuum (SC) are two common modeling approaches used for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in fractured media. Fracture continuum approaches combine the merits of each approach; details of the fracture network are preserved, and a computationally efficient grid is utilized for the solution of fluid flow by assigning a conductivity contrast between the grid cells representing the rock matrix and those representing fractures. In this paper, we propose a fracture continuum approach for mapping individual fractures onto a finite-difference grid as conductivity fields. We focus on several issues that are associated with this approach, such as enhanced connectivity between fractures that would otherwise not be in connection in a DFN simulation and the influence of grid cell size. To addresses these issues, both DFN and the proposed approach are used to solve for fluid flow through two-dimensional, randomly generated fracture networks in a steady-state, single-phase flow system. The DFN flow solution is used as a metric to evaluate the robustness of the method in translating discrete fractures onto grid cell conductivities on four different regularly spaced grids: 1 x 1 m, 2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, and 10 x 10 m. Two correction factors are introduced to ensure equivalence between the total flow of the grid and the original fracture network. The first is dependent on the fracture alignment with the grid and is set to account for the difference between the length of the flow path on the grid and that of the fracture. The other correction is applied for areas in the grid with high fracture density and accounts for the artificial degree of connectivity that exists on the grid but not in the DFN. Fifteen different cases are studied to evaluate the effect of fracture statistics on the results of the proposed approach and by taking average results of 100 realizations in each case in a stochastic Monte Carlo framework. The flow equation is solved for the DFN, and total flow is obtained. The flow is also solved separately for the four-grid resolution levels, and comparisons between the DFN and the grid total flows are made for the different cases and the different grid resolution levels. The approach performed relatively well in all cases for the fine-grid resolution, but an overestimation of grid flow is observed in the coarse-grid resolution, especially for cases wherein the network connectivity is controlled by small fractures. This overestimation shows minor variation from one realization to another within the same case. This allowed us to develop an approach that depends on solving limited number of DFN simulations to obtain this overestimation factor. Results indicate that the proposed approach provides improvements over existing approaches and has a potential to provide a link between DFN and SC models.},

The new approach requires running a streamline simulator only a few timesteps, so multi-million cell models are evaluated in minutes. Using streamline time of flight and volumetric flow rate information from the simulation, a flow capacity diagram and sweep efficiency history can be determined. Five different measures of heterogeneity can be obtained from these two diagnostic plots. We then evaluated each of these measures of heterogeneity for 450 models that were constructed using a wide range of Dykstra-Parsons coefficient and correlation lengths, and 2 different well patterns. The measures of heterogeneity were plotted against discounted oil recovery to determine the best measure of heterogeneity. From this study we conclude the Lorenz coefficient – as determined from dynamic data – is the single best measure of heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Rock masses, which commonly contain a large number of discontinuities, are treated as homogeneous, anisotropic porous media to formulate the corresponding permeability tensor. This has been successfully achieved by introducing a symmetric tensor (crack tensor) which depends only on the geometry of the related cracks (aperture, size and orientation). The principal directions associated with the symmetric crack tensor are coaxial with those of the permeability tensor. The first invariant of the crack tensor is proportional to the mean permeability, while the deviatoric part is related to the anisotropic permeability. These results are well supported by numerical experiments on the permeability of cracked media by Long, Remer, Wilson and Witherspoon. An actual rock mass (moderately jointed granite) was studied to see whether the crack tensor can be determined in situ. Stereology, based on geometrical statistics, provides a sound basis for determining the crack tensor in situ. The crack tensor is obtained by treating statistically the crack orientation data presented via a stereographic projection together with the detailed mapping of crack traces visible on rock exposures.},

abstract = {In order to improve discrete fracture network (DFN) models, which are increasingly required into groundwater and rock mechanics applications, we propose a new DFN modeling based on the evolution of fracture network formation—nucleation, growth, and arrest—with simplified mechanical rules. The central idea of the model relies on the mechanical role played by large fractures in stopping the growth of smaller ones. The modeling framework combines, in a time-wise approach, fracture nucleation, growth, and arrest. It yields two main regimes. Below a certain critical scale, the density distribution of fracture sizes is a power law with a scaling exponent directly derived from the growth law and nuclei properties; above the critical scale, a quasi-universal self-similar regime establishes with a self-similar scaling. The density term of the dense regime is related to the details of arrest rule and to the orientation distribution of the fractures. The DFN model, so defined, is fully consistent with field cases former studied. Unlike more usual stochastic DFN models, ours is based on a simplified description of fracture interactions, which eventually reproduces the multiscale self-similar fracture size distribution often observed and reported in the literature. The model is a potential significant step forward for further applications to groundwater flow and rock mechanical issues.},

abstract = {Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFR) hold a significant fraction of remaining petroleum reserves. Recovery factors from NFR are usually less than in conventional reservoirs due to associated high uncertainty throughout the characterisation and modelling phases. This particularly includes the modelling and upscaling of the fracture domain using Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN). Computer assisted history matching and prediction is becoming increasingly popular as they help finding multiple history-matched models and probabilistic forecasts. Therefore, the associated uncertainty can now be quantified in a limited time frame. However, the results of a history match are known to depend on initial reservoir properties, including fracture permeability and matrix shape factors. Geological uncertainty in these two factors is exacerbated by the DFN upscaling errors. We show how DFN modelling can be used to increase geological prior knowledge and hence produce more geologically consistent models. To highlight DFN upscaling errors, we use a realistic dataset from an onshore fractured reservoir to show how the DFN upscaling error could propagate through to the history matching phase. We compare history matching of three models with different DFN upscaling processes. Results from state-of-the-art assisted history matching and prediction were found to depend on the static properties and particularly the computation of effective fracture permeability during DFN upscaling. This upscaling error alone leads to very different reservoir models, despite the best history matched models being of comparable quality. Hence, this leads to more uncertainty in reservoir production forecast. The identification of DFN upscaling errors is therefore crucial for better uncertainty quantification in reservoir simulation of NFR. Copyright 2013, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract = {This paper describes a hybrid finite volume method, designed to simulate multiphase flow in a field-scale naturally fractured reservoir. Lee et al. (WRR 37:443-455, 2001) developed a hierarchical approach in which the permeability contribution from short fractures is derived in an analytical expression that from medium fractures is numerically solved using a boundary element method. The long fractures are modeled explicitly as major fluid conduits. Reservoirs with well-developed natural fractures include many complex fracture networks that cannot be easily modeled by simple long fracture formulation and/or homogenized single continuity model. We thus propose a numerically efficient hybrid method in which small and medium fractures are modeled by effective permeability, and large fractures are modeled by discrete fracture networks. A simple, systematic way is devised to calculate transport parameters between fracture networks and discretized, homogenized media. An efficient numerical algorithm is also devised to solve the dual system of fracture network and finite volume grid. Black oil formulation is implemented in the simulator to demonstrate practical applications of this hybrid finite volume method.},

In this paper, the small and medium fractures are upscaled into an equivalent matrix and then large fractures represented explicitly.

Points to consider:
-The upscaling is done via single phase upscaling. Valid for multiphase flow? Have we studied errors induced in this? Also, have we considered that only one realization is not enough to generate a proper expected performance?
-All fractures are generated stochastically, including the large ones. The large ones are represented explicitly in this model. In order to obtain the expected performance, more realizations are needed, meaning this model will be run more times. Is this better than perhaps other methods that relax the geometric representation of the fractures and use equivalent medium properties that represent some form of statistically expected property?},

Explicit methods are faster and simpler to use than implicit methods but may have a more limited range of validity. Five explicit methods are considered: the Maxwell approximation, the T-matrix method, the symmetric and asymmetric weakly self-consistent methods, and the weakly differential method, where the two latter methods are novelly constructed in this paper. For each method, we develop simplified expressions applicable to flat spheroidal “penny-shaped” inclusions. The simplified expressions are accurate to the first order in the ratio of fracture thickness to fracture diameter. Our analysis shows that the conductivity predictions of the methods fall within known upper and lower bounds, except for the T-matrix method at high fracture densities and the symmetric weakly self-consistent method when applied to very thin fractures. Comparisons with numerical results show that all the methods give reliable estimates for small fracture densities. For high fracture densities, the weakly differential method is the most accurate if the fracture geometry is non-percolating or the fracture/matrix conductivity contrast is small. For percolating conductive fracture networks, we have developed a scaling relation that can be applied to the weakly self-consistent methods to give conductivity estimates that are close to the results from numerical simulations.},

abstract = {The presence of fractures at various scales affects the flow dynamics within a reservoir, thus casting uncertainty on the assessment of the field productivity and reserves. Methodologies and tools are now available (i) to reconstruct geologically-realistic models of the fault/fracture network (ii) to turn these models into simplified conceptual models usable for field-scale simulations of multi-phase production methods. However, a critical intermediate step remains that of validating the geometry of the geological fault/fracture network and characterizing it in terms of flow properties. An original 3D Discrete Fracture Network simulator enabling one to fulfil this characterization step has already been presented by the authors{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This simulator can compute the single-phase flow response of any type of fractured reservoir, whatever the scale, density and connectivity of fractures. An extension of this simulator to compute tracer tests is presented in this paper. Compared with pressure tests, tracer tests may provide additional information about the reservoir heterogeneity due to the convective nature of these tests. This simulator is based on the dual-medium concept applied to an explicit representation of the geological model of fault/fracture network and matrix medium. The transport and dispersion of non-reactive tracers are modelled by introducing a convection-dispersion equation into the existing dual-porosity flow model. A hybrid scheme discretizes the convective term implicitly within densely fractured regions for stability purposes, and explicitly via a double-upstream scheme everywhere else for reducing spurious numerical dispersion. After demonstrating the reliability of this tracer model on validation cases, a realistic case that combines diffuse fracturing and major objects such as seismic and sub-seismic faults is studied. Tracer tests are simulated for wells in a five-spot injection/production pattern. Effects of a fracture/matrix tracer exchange as well as a Taylor-Aris dispersion on breakthrough curves are analyzed. The potentiality of tracer responses for providing information on the distribution of reservoir heterogeneities is discussed. Copyright 2005, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

The methodology can be used to evaluate, rank, and/or compare realizations or strategies, and the computational speed makes it ideal for interactive visualization output. We also consider application of flow diagnostics as proxies in optimization of reservoir-management work flows. In particular, by use of finite-volume discretizations for pressure, time of flight (TOF), and stationary tracers, we efficiently compute general Lorenz coefficients (and variants) that are shown to correlate well with simulated recovery. For efficient optimization, we develop an adjoint code for gradient computations of the considered flow-diagnostic measures. We present several numerical examples, including optimization of rates, well placements, and drilling sequences for two- and three-phase synthetic and real field models. Overall, optimizing the diagnostic measures implies substantial improvement in simulation-based objectives.},

abstract = {Hydrogeology is a topical and growing subject as the earth's water resources become scarcer and more vulnerable. More than half of the surface area of continents is covered with hard rocks of low permiability.This book deals comprehensively with the fundamental principles for understanding the hydrogeological characteristics of rocks, as well as exploration techniques and assessment. It also provides in depth discussion on structural mapping, remote sensing, geophysical exploration, GIS, groundwater flow modelling and contaminant transport, field hydraulic testing including tracer tests, groundwater quality, geothermal reservoirs, managed aquifer recharge, and resources assessment and management.Hydrogeological aspects of various lithology groups, including crystalline rocks, volcanic rocks, carbonate rocks and clastic formations have been dealt with separately, using and discussing examples from all over the world. It will be an invaluable text book cum reference source for postgraduate students, researchers, exploration scientists and engineers engaged in the field of groundwater development in fractured rocks.Applied Hydrogeology of Fractured Rocks - Second Edition is thoroughly revised and extended with a new chapter, updated sections, many new examples, and expanded and updated references.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {Since a large amount of nanopores exist in tight oil reservoirs, fluid transport in nanopores is complex due to large capillary pressure. Recent studies only focus on the effect of nanopore confinement on single-well performance with simple planar fractures in tight oil reservoirs. Its impacts on multi-well performance with complex fracture geometries have not been reported. In this study, a numerical model was developed to investigate the effect of confined phase behavior on cumulative oil and gas production of four horizontal wells with different fracture geometries. Its pore sizes were divided into five regions based on nanopore size distribution. Then, fluid properties were evaluated under different levels of capillary pressure using Peng-Robinson equation of state. Afterwards, an efficient approach of Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) was applied to explicitly model hydraulic and natural fractures in the reservoirs. Finally, three fracture geometries, i.e. non-planar hydraulic fractures, non-planar hydraulic fractures with one set natural fractures, and non-planar hydraulic fractures with two sets natural fractures, are evaluated. The multi-well performance with confined phase behavior is analyzed with permeabilities of 0.01 md and 0.1 md. This work improves the analysis of capillarity effect on multi-well performance with complex fracture geometries in tight oil reservoirs. Tight reservoirs make significant contributions to the oil and gas productions in recent years. These reservoirs are unique because of the low permeability, which requires multiple horizontal wells and multistage hydraulic fractures for economic production 1 . Permeability is the intrinsic property of rocks, which measures the ability of rocks to allow liquids or gases to flow through it. Permeability is typically expressed in units of millidarcy (md), and a large value indicates the liquids or gases are highly permeable through rocks. Since the natural fractures are generally distributed in the formation, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is an efficient approach to generate a large contact area between the wellbore and low permeability formation. The actual fracturing process often creates complex fracture geometries in tight reservoirs due to the pre-existing natural fractures 2,3},
